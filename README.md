# SVG file parsing / rendering library

The main purpose of this lib is to rasterize SVG to a surface which can be an image or a PDF for example, through a `\Svg\Surface` PHP interface.

This project was initialized by the need to render SVG documents inside PDF files for the [DomPdf](http://dompdf.github.io) project.
